Fix data loading errors: Date decoding and request cancellation

This commit fixes three critical issues preventing proper data loading
when switching between tabs (Accounts, Subscriptions, Revenue):

1. Date Decoding Error
   - Enhanced date decoder to handle Supabase microsecond timestamps
   - Added regex preprocessing for 6-digit fractional seconds
   - Unified decoder usage across all fetch methods

2. Request Cancellation Errors
   - Implemented task management in all ViewModels
   - Added graceful cancellation handling
   - Filtered -999 error codes from user-facing alerts
   - Changed from parallel to sequential data fetching

3. Inconsistent Data Fetching
   - Updated fetchAccounts() to use custom decoder
   - Standardized error handling across all fetch methods
   - Improved logging for better debugging

Files modified:
- Services/SupabaseService.swift (date decoder + fetch consistency)
- ViewModels/AccountsViewModel.swift (task cancellation)
- ViewModels/SubscriptionsViewModel.swift (task cancellation)
- ViewModels/RevenueViewModel.swift (task cancellation)
- ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.swift (task cancellation)

Documentation added:
- DATA_LOADING_FIX.md (technical details)
- CHANGES_SUMMARY.md (quick reference)
- VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md (testing guide)

Testing:
- No linter errors
- All ViewModels handle cancellation
- Date formats tested with microsecond precision
- Sequential loading prevents connection overload

Fixes: Date format errors, cancelled request dialogs, rapid tab switching issues
